This handbook assumes that you have access to a live instance of the DLR database on SQL Server. The development of the DLR programme was driven by the need to measure individuals' load profiles as well as understanding **who** the individuals were. 

# Data Overview
## Parameters monitored
In designing the programme, the cause and effect correlations of previously performed load research studies were mapped and condensed to the parameters that were ultimately monitored in the study.

## Socio-demographic data collected
### Information about the people
* Number of people living in house
* Age of home owner
* Gender of home owner
* Level of education of home owner
* Income of home owner
* Employment status of home owner

### Information about the dwelling
* Number of rooms
* Street address
* GPS coordinates
* Structure (ceiling or not)
* Floor area
* Building materials

### Information about appliances
* Number of light bulbs in dwelling (does not distinguish energy saving bulbs)
* Number of people being cooked for
* Fuel source for cooking (quantities used not captured)
* Frequency of cooking

# Project Timeline 1993 - 2014
## Sites & number of people surveyed over the history of the project
## Project Evolution over time
**1993**   
|  
| Project start  
|  
**2000**  
|  
| added rural  
| added GPS coordinates (taken at front gate/door of dwelling)  
| combined Eskom & municipal data sets    
| consolidated the two existing versions of socio-demographic data collected in the questionnaires  
|  
**2004**  
|  
| matched prepaid tranasctions with meter numbers to verify household energy consumption  
| data loggers measured up to 16 channels current & one voltage across all channels    
| > inferred power from measurement  
| > errors at low current  
|  
**2009**    
|  
| data logger format changed
| > wireless logging  
| > 1 channel for up to 3 houses  
| > voltage, current, real power and reactive power recorded  
| > changed to cts that can handle low current error  
| did not manage to close calibration loop (ie verifying calibration of individual appliances)  
|  
**2012**  
|  
| migrated to mobile data capture  
| added some 'jump driven' loggers to separate out appliances
