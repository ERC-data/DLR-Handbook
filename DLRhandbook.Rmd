--------------------------------

This handbook assumes that you have access to a live instance of the DLR database on SQL Server. The development of the DLR programme was driven by the need to measure individuals' load profiles as well as understanding **who** the individuals were.

__\* CODE \*__  
All SQL code snippets and stored procedures are available on github at [ERC-data/DLR-Handbook/SQLProcedures](https://github.com/ERC-data/DLR-Handbook).

# Data Overview
## Parameters monitored
In designing the programme, the cause and effect correlations of previously performed load research studies were mapped and condensed to the parameters that were ultimately monitored in the study.

##  Data collected with questionnaires
For a full list of survey questions asked, view the supporting document _NLRquestionnaires.Rmd_ .

### Socio-demographic data: information about the people
* Number of people living in house
* Age of home owner
* Gender of home owner
* Level of education of home owner
* Income of home owner
* Employment status of home owner

### Information about the dwelling
* Number of rooms
* Street address
* GPS coordinates
* Structure (ceiling or not)
* Floor area
* Building materials

### Information about appliances
* Number of light bulbs in dwelling (does not distinguish energy saving bulbs)
* Number of people being cooked for
* Fuel source for cooking (quantities used not captured)
* Frequency of cooking

## Load data collected

# Project Timeline 1993 - 2014
## Sites & number of people surveyed over the history of the project
On average the DLR project has monitored: 

* 800 households per year
* +- 60 households per site
* 10 sites per year
* monitoring period 5 years/site for Eskom customers, shorter for municipal customers

The number of sites monitored per year as part of the South African DLR are as follows:

Year | Sites | GroupIDs
----|:----:|:------
1994| 1 | 34

## Project Evolution over time
**1993**   
|  
| Project start  
|  
**2000**  
|  
| added rural households 
| added GPS coordinates (taken at front gate/door of dwelling)  
| combined Eskom & municipal data sets    
| consolidated the two existing versions of socio-demographic data collected in the questionnaires  
|  
**2004**  
|  
| matched prepaid tranasctions with meter numbers to verify household energy consumption  
| data loggers measured up to 16 channels current & one voltage across all channels    
| > inferred power from measurement  
| > errors at low current  
|  
**2009**    
|  
| data logger format changed
| > wireless logging  
| > 1 channel for up to 3 houses  
| > voltage, current, real power and reactive power recorded  
| > changed to cts that can handle low current error  
| did not manage to close calibration loop (ie verifying calibration of individual appliances)  
|  
**2012**  
|  
| migrated to mobile data capture  
| added some 'jump driven' loggers to separate out appliances

# Data Checking
## Socio-demographic verification
The DLR has heavily standardised data treatment. Socio-demographic data was collected in 2 phases. **Phase 1** (pre 2000) caputred on paper was verified with a visual test. For **Phase 2** (post 2000) error checking has been implemented with rules checking on the database. The following validation process has been followed:

* verify if a data source or data capture problem exists
* correct demographic data if possible by checking the paper source
* remaining errors are residual and not possible to solve by inspection

### Socio checking rules



## Measurement verification

### Site reference database
Every winter the connectivity has been traced from the data logger to each household to verify the recording channels. From this, a site reference database has been created.

## Data Validation

# Database Structure
## Tables
Groups, Questions, Answers, Profiles & Link table

### Primary Tables
#### dbo.Context
The context table provides a list of all the projects and project phases that were executed as part of the DLR Programme. A project is a load research study that was implemented outside the 'normal' South African residential electricity sector, which was the focus of the programme. A phase marks a point in time where the programme underwent a significant change of methodology, such as a change in questionnaire or logger used. The projects and phases are:

* NRS LR 2000
* NRS LR 1994 -1999
* NRS LR 2009
* NRS LR 2010
* Namibia 2000
* Non-domestic - Clinics (NonDom_clinics)
* Non-domestic - Shops (NonDom_shops)
* Non-domestic - Schools (NonDom_schools)

#### dbo.Groups
A group is a set of households that was surveyed and whose load profiles were recorded as part of a project or phase within the DLR Programme in a specific year, at a specific location. The ParentID attribute can be used to navigate through the groups structure. The following hierarchy structure has been applied to groups:

Desciption | GroupIDs 
-----------|---------
__Top level__ (DLR/non-domestic) | 7, 1000000
__Second level__ (grouped by PROJECT; lowest level for non-domestic) | 1, 9, 89, 1000001, 1000002, 1000003
__Third level__ (grouped by YEAR; DLR only) | 14, 26, 29-34, 74-76, 90-92, 97, 99, 112, 119, 1000006, 1000015, 1000020, 1000021, 1000030, 1000037, 1000047, 1000048, 1000061, 1000067, 1000070, 1000074, 1000080, 1000086, 1000091, 1000094, 1000110, 1000121, 1000135
__Fourth level__ (grouped by LOCATION) | rest
Namibia | 89, 90, 91, 92
Clinics | 1000003
Schools | 1000002
Shops | 1000001

#### dbo.Questionnaires
7 different surveys have been created and administred to different users to gather socio-economic data, dwelling and appliance information. 

QuestionnaireID | Description
---|---
3 | NLR Main form
6 | NRS Form 1994-1999 (pre-2000 questionnaire)
7 | Namibia Form
8 | Alternative Energies
1000000 | Clinic Questionaire
1000001 | Shop Questionaire
1000002 | School Questionaire

#### dbo.Questions
Each question has an ID and is associated with one of the seven questionaires. The ColumnNo field can be used to match a survey answer of a specific type to a question. Questions and their answers are recorded as one of 3 types:

Datatype | Description | db Table
---|---|---
1 | long text (blob) | dbo.Answers_blob
2 | short text (char) | dbo.Answers_char
3 | number | dbo.Answers_number
